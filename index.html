      <h1>The Gamified Habit Change App Every Lambda Student Needs</h1>
        <p>
          Lambda School is insanely hard by design (trust us, we know!). <br> 
          But that doesn't mean you must sacrifice your health and fitness to become a web developer. <br>
          With our help, you'll prevent burnout and boost every aspect of wellness... while exceling in your studies. <br>

      <h2>The Everyday Struggles of Learning at Lambda School</h2>
        <p> We took a poll of 50+ Lambda School students. 50% feel as if they don't have time for anything 
            that doesn't involve web development. While code <em>is</em> life, it shouldn't consume your <strong>entire</strong> life.
            Agree? Keep reading.

      <h2>Meet Refresh: A Healthy Habit App Made for Students, by Students</h2>
        <p>
            We know all about the biggest stressors that plague most Lambdanites. Lectures that go over, forcing you to skip
            lunch for fear of getting behind later. The terror that takes over when you go blank during a Sprint Challenge.
            That frustrating moment when you shut down, thinking you're done for the day, before remembering you forgot to
            fill out your thousandth retrospective of the week.

      <h2>Why Most Health and Fitness Apps Fail to Deliver Meaningful Results</h2>
        <p>
            There are a million apps on the market that promise to help you develop healthy habits. Most are useless.
            Why? They're not designed with your specific needs and pain points in mind. These habit apps are too focused on gaining 
            the largest possible userbase. In the process, they create an app that's too arbitrary to be effective for most people.
            Refresh is different. Our app is custom made for you, the average Lambda student.

      <h2>Small Changes to Your Daily Routine Can Have a Massive Impact on Your Well-Being</h2>
        <p>
            Habit change isn't sexy. But it's 100% necessary. You are a product of your daily routines. If all you do is 
            stare at a computer, don't be surprised when you feel miserable. Life isn't meant to be lived in front of a screen, 
            friend. <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/regular-exercise-is-part-of-your-job">Science shows</a>
            people are more productive when they exercise. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110208131529.htm">
            Research reveals</a> short breaks boost efficiency. Our app will help you implement this evidence in a fun and easy fashion.
